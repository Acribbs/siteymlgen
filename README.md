siteymlgen makes it easy to organise R Markdown website output. The
init() function placed within the first code chunk of the index.Rmd file
of an R project directory will initiate the generation of an
automatically written \_site.yml file. siteymlgen recomends a specific
naming convention for your markdown files. This naming will ensure that
your navbar layout is ordered according to a heirarchy.

## Installation

You can install siteymlgen â€¦:

``` r
```

Or you can install the development version of siteymlgen from GitHub
with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Acribbs/siteymlgen")
```

## Naming convention

In order to control how your website navbar is ordered then you need to
stick to the following naming convention:

`[A-Z][1-9]_TitleofTab.Rmd`

e.g. `A1_FileOne.Rmd`

The capital first letter of the file name controls the position of the
tab in the navbar. The number controls the position within the dropdown
menu, if you do not want a dropdown menu then label the file
\[A-Z\]1\_TitleofTab.Rmd.

# Example

R Markdown to generate a complete website and \_site.yml controls the
layout of this:

Put your `.Rmd` files in a single directory. `index.Rmd` will become the
home page.

Add an empty YAML file named `_site.yml`, which will be populated by
siteymlgen according to your file names and input options supplied to
`init()`.

Next configure your build tools in Rstudio so that you can build
websites:

Then build your website:

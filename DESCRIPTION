Title: Automatically Generate _site.yml File for R Markdown
Version: 2.0.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Adam",
           family = "Cribbs",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "adam.cribbs@ndorms.ox.ac.uk",
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-5288-3077"))
Description: The goal of siteymlgen is to make it easy to organise
  the building of your R Markdown website. 
  The init() function placed within the first code chunk of the index.Rmd
  file of an R project directory will initiate the generation of an automatically 
  written _site.yml file. siteymlgen recommends a specific naming
  convention for your markdown files. This naming will ensure that
  your navbar layout is ordered according to a hierarchy.
